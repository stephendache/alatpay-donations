## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

After installation, you **must** configure your ALATPay credentials:

## üìù Usage

To display the donation form on any page, post, or widget area that supports shortcodes, use the following:

### Basic Shortcode:

```

[alatpay\_donation\_form]

```

### Customizing Amounts and Text:

You can customize the suggested amounts and the form's display text using attributes:

```

[alatpay_donation_form 
    title="Help Us Reach Our Goal" 
    description="Every Naira counts. Choose an amount or enter your own." 
    amounts="500, 1000, custom, 5000"
]
```

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this plugin require WooCommerce?**
A: No. This plugin is built as a standalone solution for fundraising and does not rely on the WooCommerce cart system.

**Q: How do I handle payment confirmation?**
A: All confirmation is handled by **ALATPay's webhook**. You **MUST configure this webhook** in your ALATPay merchant dashboard to ensure donations are automatically marked as 'successful' on your WordPress site.

**Q: Where can I change the default suggested donation amounts?**
A: You can set the suggested amounts directly within the shortcode by using the `amounts` attribute, separating values with a comma (e.g., `amounts="1000,2000,5000"`).

**Q: How do I allow donors to enter their own amount?**
A: Use the keyword custom within the amounts attribute of the shortcode (e.g., amounts="1000, custom, 5000"). The plugin will automatically render a user input field for that option.
